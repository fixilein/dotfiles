# Defining window-specific flash rules
#
# Flash rules are defined by matching the WM_CLASS property of a window.
# To get the WM_CLASS property of a window use 'xprop WM_CLASS' and click on a
# window. The property is a tuple of the form (window-id, window-class). The
# window-class is usually the name of the application, but not always.
